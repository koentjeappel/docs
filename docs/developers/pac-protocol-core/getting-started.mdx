# Getting Started (with HTTP API)

Source Code of **PAC Protocol Core** can be found under [GitHub pacprotocol/pacprotocol](https://github.com/pacprotocol/pacprotocol)

For the following step we're using the user root. For production usage it's recommended to use different user with no admin permission.

## Install PAC Protocol Core Daemon

### Requirements

* Minimum 1GB RAM
* Minimum 25GB Hard Disk
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or newer. (Windows and macOS supports it too, but we're focusing on ubuntu)



### Step 1 - Get/Setup binaries of PAC Protocol Core

We're pulling the binaries of "PAC Global v0.15.2" and grant permission of "pacglobald" and "pacglobal-cli" to make it executeable.

```bash
cd /root # we're using root directory in this example. You can obviously choose your owh directory.
wget --progress=dot -e dot_bytes=100M -e dots_in_line=1 https://github.com/PACGlobalOfficial/PAC/releases/download/v0.15.2/pacglobal-v0.15.2-lin64.tgz
tar -xzvf pacglobal-v0.15.2-lin64.tgz
rm -f pacglobal-v0.15.2-lin64.tgz
mv -v pacglobal-v0.15.2-lin64 PACProtocol
chmod +x PACProtocol/pacglobald
chmod +x PACProtocol/pacglobal-cli
```

### Step 2 - Configuring the wallet

To configure the PAC Protocol Core, you need to enter following commands.

```bash
mkdir /root/.PACProtocol
cd /root/.PACProtocol
nano pacprotocol.conf # or any other file editor you want
```

Following settings in `pacprotocol.conf` is recommended to enable RPC JSON HTTP API:

```bash
# pacprotocol.conf

rpcuser=<choose any username>
rpcpassword=<create a good password>
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 # Listen only to local machine.
rpcport=7111

listen=1
server=1
daemon=1
```
You can find more options under [Daemon Options](/docs/core/developers/pac-protocol-core/daemon-options)

Save it and back to terminal.

### Step 3 - Creating systemctl service (optional, recommended)

This step is not necessary, but it helps to run PAC Protocol Core in background and it auto-start in case of crashing. It will also start automatically when the machine is turned on.

Skip to [Step 4](#step-4---testing-if-its-working) if you don't want to use systemctl service.

``` bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/pac.service # or any other file editor you want
```

With the following content of pac.service:

```bash
# pac.service

[Unit]
Description=PAC Protocol Core Daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
Group=root
Type=forking
PIDFile=/root/.PACProtocol/pacprotocol.pid
ExecStart=/root/PACProtocol/pacprotocold -daemon -pid=/root/.PACProtocol/pacprotocol.pid \
          -conf=/root/.PACProtocol/pacprotocol.conf -datadir=/root/.PACProtocol/
ExecStop=-/root/PACProtocol/pacprotocol-cli -conf=/root/.PACProtocol/pacprotocol.conf \
          -datadir=/root/.PACProtocol/ stop
Restart=always
RestartSec=20s
PrivateTmp=true
TimeoutStopSec=7200s
TimeoutStartSec=30s
StartLimitInterval=120s
StartLimitBurst=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save it and back to terminal.

Enable the service
```bash
systemctl enable pac.service
```

And start the service

```bash
systemctl start pac.service
```

If you want to stop the service (stopping the PAC Protocol Core Daemon instance)

```bash
systemctl stop pac.service
```

### Step 4 - Testing if it's working.

Now your PAC Protocol Core Daemon is ready to be used for development purpose.

If you skipped the [Step 3](#step-3---creating-systemctl-service-optional-recommended), you can run daemon by following step:

```bash
./root/PACProtocol/pacprotocold  -daemon
```

Wait for a some time and then you can ping the HTTP RPC JSON if it's functional:

```bash
curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc":"1.0","id":"curltext","method":"getblockchaininfo","params":[]}' -H 'content-type:text/plain;' http://<rpcusername>:<rpcpassword>@127.0.0.1:7111/
```

The `rpcusername` and `rpcpassword` is the same as from [Step 2](#step-2---configuring-the-wallet)

You can validate if the blockchain is fully synced:

```bash
curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc":"1.0","id":"curltext","method":"mnsync","params":["status"]}' -H 'content-type:text/plain;' http://<rpcusername>:<rpcpassword>@127.0.0.1:7111/
```

If `"isBlockchainSynced"` is `true`, it means the blockchain on your machine is fully synced!

It can take some time to sync fully. Luckly we have a solution for that in order to sync it faster - please see the following tutorial [Install Bootstrap](/docs/core/developers/pac-protocol-core/install-bootstrap)

Congratulation. Now you have a self-hosted PAC Protocol HTTP API which you can use on your language/framework by using HTTP requests!
