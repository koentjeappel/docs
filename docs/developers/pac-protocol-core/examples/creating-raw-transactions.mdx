# Creating Raw Transactions

If you need absolute control of the transactions, you can create your own & broadcast transaction without using [sendtoaddress](/developers/pac-protocol-core/client-commands/sendtoaddress) or [sendmany](/developers/pac-protocol-core/client-commands/sendmany)

### Make Transaction:

```bash
rawHexString = createrawtransaction [{"txid":"id","vout":n},...] {"address":amount,"data":"hex",...} ( locktime )
```
[createrawtransaction documentation](/developers/pac-protocol-core/client-commands/createrawtransaction)

`rawHexString` is the variable and it contains the value of raw transaction in string (encoded as hex).

Before broadcasting you need to sign the transaction first to validate that you own input's private key

### Sign Transaction:

```bash
signedRawHexString = signrawtransaction rawHexString ( [{"txid":"id","vout":n,"scriptPubKey":"hex","redeemScript":"hex"},...] ["privatekey1",...] sighashtype )
```
[signrawtransaction documentation](/developers/pac-protocol-core/client-commands/signrawtransaction)

`signedRawHexString` is the same as `rawHexString` except it's signed and ready to be broadcasted to the network.

### Broadcast Transaction:

```
transactionId = sendrawtransaction signedRawHexString ( allowhighfees instantsend bypasslimits)
```
[signrawtransaction documentation](/developers/pac-protocol-core/client-commands/sendrawtransaction)

`transactionId` is the txid of your transaction which you can now track if it got any confirmations or not.
