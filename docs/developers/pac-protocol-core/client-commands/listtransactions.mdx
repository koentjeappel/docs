# listtransactions
## Command

```bash
pacprotocol-cli listtransactions (label count skip include_watchonly)
```

If a label name is provided, this will return only incoming transactions paying to addresses with the specified label.

Returns up to 'count' most recent transactions skipping the first 'from' transactions.
Note that the "account" argument and "otheraccount" return value have been removed in V0.17. To use this RPC with an "account" argument, restart
pacprotocold with -deprecatedrpc=accounts



## Arguments

### `label` 
*(string, optional)*

If set, should be a valid label name to return only incoming transactions
              with the specified label, or "*" to disable filtering and return all transactions.


### `count` 
*(numeric, optional, default=10)*

The number of transactions to return


### `skip` 
*(numeric, optional, default=0)*

The number of transactions to skip


### `include_watchonly` 
*( bool, optional, default=false)*

Include transactions to watch-only addresses (see 'importaddress')


## Examples


List the most recent 10 transactions in the systems

```bash
pacprotocol-cli listtransactions 
```



List transactions 100 to 120

```bash
pacprotocol-cli listtransactions "" 20 100
```



As a json rpc call

```bash
curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "listtransactions", "params": ["", 20, 100] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:1111/
