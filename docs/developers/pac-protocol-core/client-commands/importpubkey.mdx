# importpubkey
## Command

```bash
pacprotocol-cli importpubkey "pubkey" ( "label" rescan )
```

Adds a public key (in hex) that can be watched as if it were in your wallet but cannot be used to spend. Requires a new wallet backup.



## Arguments

### `pubkey` <span class='asterisk'>*</span>
*(string, required)*

The hex-encoded public key


### `label` 
*(string, optional, default="")*

An optional label


### `rescan` 
*(boolean, optional, default=true)*

Rescan the wallet for transactions


## Examples
Note: This call can take over an hour to complete if rescan is true, during that time, other rpc calls

may report that the imported pubkey exists but related transactions are still missing, leading to temporarily incorrect/bogus balances and unspent outputs until rescan completes.





Import a public key with rescan

```bash
pacprotocol-cli importpubkey "mypubkey"
```



Import using a label without rescan

```bash
pacprotocol-cli importpubkey "mypubkey" "testing" false
```



As a JSON-RPC call

```bash
curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "importpubkey", "params": ["mypubkey", "testing", false] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:1111/
```
