# gettxoutproof
## Command

```bash
pacprotocol-cli gettxoutproof ["txid",...] ( blockhash )
```

Returns a hex-encoded proof that "txid" was included in a block.

NOTE: By default this function only works sometimes. This is when there is an
unspent output in the utxo for this transaction. To make it always work,
you need to maintain a transaction index, using the -txindex command line option or
specify the block in which the transaction is included manually (by blockhash).



## Arguments

### `txids` 
*(string)*

A json array of txids to filter
    


```json
[
    "txid"     (string) A transaction hash
    ,...
]
```



### `blockhash` 
*(string, optional)*

If specified, looks for txid in the block with this hash


## Examples
```bash
pacprotocol-cli gettxoutproof '["mytxid",...]'
```

```bash
pacprotocol-cli gettxoutproof '["mytxid",...]' "blockhash"
```

```bash
curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "gettxoutproof", "params": [["mytxid",...], "blockhash"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:1111/
```
## Result
```bash
"data"           #(string) A string that is a serialized, hex-encoded data for the proof.
```
