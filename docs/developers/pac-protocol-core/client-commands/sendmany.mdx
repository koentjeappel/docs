# sendmany
## Command

```bash
pacprotocol-cli sendmany "" {"address":amount,...} ( minconf addlocked "comment" ["address",...] subtractfeefrom use_is use_cj conf_target "estimate_mode")
```

Send multiple times. Amounts are double-precision floating point numbers.Note that the "fromaccount" argument has been removed in V0.17. To use this RPC with a "fromaccount" argument, restart
pacprotocold with -deprecatedrpc=accounts




## Arguments

### `dummy` <span class='asterisk'>*</span>
*(string, required)*

### `amounts` <span class='asterisk'>*</span>
*(string, required)*

A json object with addresses and amounts
    


```json
{
    "address":amount     (numeric or string) The PAC address is the key, the numeric amount (can be string) in PAC is the value
    ,...
}
```



### `minconf`

### `subtractfeefrom` 
*(array, optional)*

                           The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each selected address.
                           Those recipients will receive less pacprotocols than you enter in their corresponding amount field.
                           If no addresses are specified here, the sender pays the fee.
    


```json
[
    "address"        (string) Subtract fee from this address
    ,...
]
```



### `use_is` 
*(bool, optional, default=false)*

Deprecated and ignored


### `use_cj` 
*(bool, optional, default=false)*

Use CoinJoin funds only


### `conf_target` 
*(numeric, optional)*

### `estimate_mode` 
*(string, optional, default=UNSET)*

The fee estimate mode, must be one of:
       "UNSET"
       "ECONOMICAL"
       "CONSERVATIVE"


## Examples


Send two amounts to two different addresses:

```bash
pacprotocol-cli sendmany "" "{\"XwnLY9Tf7Zsef8gMGL2fhWA9ZmMjt4KPwG\":0.01,\"XuQQkwA4FYkq2XERzMY2CiAZhJTEDAbtcG\":0.02}"
```



Send two amounts to two different addresses setting the confirmation and comment:

```bash
pacprotocol-cli sendmany "" "{\"XwnLY9Tf7Zsef8gMGL2fhWA9ZmMjt4KPwG\":0.01,\"XuQQkwA4FYkq2XERzMY2CiAZhJTEDAbtcG\":0.02}" 6 false "testing"
```



As a json rpc call

```bash
curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "sendmany", "params": ["", "{\"XwnLY9Tf7Zsef8gMGL2fhWA9ZmMjt4KPwG\":0.01,\"XuQQkwA4FYkq2XERzMY2CiAZhJTEDAbtcG\":0.02}", 6, false, "testing"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:1111/
```
## Result
```bash
"txid"                   #(string) The transaction id for the send. Only 1 transaction is created regardless of 
                                    the number of addresses.
```
