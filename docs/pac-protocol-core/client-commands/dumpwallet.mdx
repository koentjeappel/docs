# dumpwallet
## Command

```bash
pacprotocol-cli dumpwallet "filename"
```

Dumps all wallet keys in a human-readable format to a server-side file. This does not allow overwriting existing files.
Imported scripts are included in the dumpfile too, their corresponding addresses will be added automatically by importwallet.
Note that if your wallet contains keys which are not derived from your HD seed (e.g. imported keys), these are not covered by
only backing up the seed itself, and must be backed up too (e.g. ensure you back up the whole dumpfile).



## Arguments

### `filename` <span class='asterisk'>*</span>
*(string, required)*

The filename with path (either absolute or relative to pacprotocold)


## Examples
```bash
pacprotocol-cli dumpwallet "test"
```

```bash
curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "dumpwallet", "params": ["test"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:1111/
```
## Result
```json
{                           #(json object)
  "keys" : {            #(int) The number of keys contained in the wallet dump
  "filename" : {        #(string) The filename with full absolute path
  "warning" : {         #(string) A warning about not sharing the wallet dump with anyone
}
```
