# upgradetohd
## Command

```bash
pacprotocol-cli upgradetohd ( "mnemonic" "mnemonicpassphrase" "walletpassphrase" )
```

Warning: You will need to make a new backup of your wallet after setting the HD wallet mnemonic.



## Arguments

### `mnemonic` 
*(string, optional, default="")*

Mnemonic as defined in BIP39 to use for the new HD wallet.
                          Use an empty string "" to generate a new random mnemonic.


### `mnemonicpassphrase` 
*(string, optional, default="")*

Optional mnemonic passphrase as defined in BIP39

*(string, optional)*

If your wallet is encrypted you must have your wallet passphrase here.

## Examples
```bash
pacprotocol-cli upgradetohd 
```

```bash
pacprotocol-cli upgradetohd "mnemonicword1 ... mnemonicwordN"
```

```bash
pacprotocol-cli upgradetohd "mnemonicword1 ... mnemonicwordN" "mnemonicpassphrase"
