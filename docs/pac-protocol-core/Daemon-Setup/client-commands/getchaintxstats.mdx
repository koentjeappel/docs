## Result
```json
{
  "time": xxxxx,                         #(numeric) The timestamp for the final block in the window in UNIX format.
  "txcount": xxxxx,                      #(numeric) The total number of transactions in the chain up to that point.
  "window_final_block_hash": "...",      #(string) The hash of the final block in the window.
  "window_block_count": xxxxx,           #(numeric) Size of the window in number of blocks.
  "window_tx_count": xxxxx,              #(numeric) The number of transactions in the window. Only returned if "window_block_count" is &gt; 0.
  "window_interval": xxxxx,              #(numeric) The elapsed time in the window in seconds. Only returned if "window_block_count" is &gt; 0.
  "txrate": x.xx,                        #(numeric) The average rate of transactions per second in the window. Only returned if "window_interval" is &gt; 0.
