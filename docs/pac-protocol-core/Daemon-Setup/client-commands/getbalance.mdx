# getbalance
## Command

```bash
pacprotocol-cli getbalance ( "(dummy)" minconf addlocked include_watchonly )
```

Returns the total available balance.
The available balance is what the wallet considers currently spendable, and is
thus affected by options which limit spendability such as -spendzeroconfchange.



## Arguments

### `(dummy)` 
*(string, optional)*

Remains for backward compatibility. Must be excluded or set to "*".


### `minconf` 
*(numeric, optional, default=0)*

Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.


### `addlocked` 
*(bool, optional, default=false)*

Whether to include the value of transactions locked via InstantSend in the wallet's balance.


### `include_watchonly` 
*( bool, optional, default=false)*

Also include balance in watch-only addresses (see 'importaddress')


## Examples


The total amount in the wallet with 1 or more confirmations

```bash
pacprotocol-cli getbalance 
```



The total amount in the wallet at least 6 blocks confirmed

```bash
pacprotocol-cli getbalance "*" 6
```



As a json rpc call

```bash
curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getbalance", "params": ["*", 6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:1111/
```
## Result
```bash
amount              #(numeric) The total amount in PAC received for this account.
```
