# Creating Raw Transactions

If you need absolute control of the transactions, you can create your own & broadcast transaction without using [sendtoaddress](/pac-protocol-core/client-commands/sendtoaddress) or [sendmany](/pac-protocol-core/client-commands/sendmany)

### Make Transaction:

```bash
createrawtransaction [{"txid":"id","vout":n},...] {"address":amount,"data":"hex",...} (locktime)
```
[createrawtransaction documentation](/pac-protocol-core/client-commands/createrawtransaction)

Returns the value of raw transaction in string (encoded as hex).

Before broadcasting you need to sign the transaction first to validate that you own input's private key

### Sign Transaction:

```bash
signrawtransaction <raw-transaction-hex> ( [{"txid":"id","vout":n,"scriptPubKey":"hex","redeemScript":"hex"},...] ["privatekey1",...] sighashtype )
```
[signrawtransaction documentation](/pac-protocol-core/client-commands/signrawtransaction)

Returns the value of raw signed transaction which can be used to broadcast it into network.

### Broadcast Transaction:

```
sendrawtransaction <raw-signed-transaction-hex> (allowhighfees instantsend bypasslimits)
```
[signrawtransaction documentation](/pac-protocol-core/client-commands/sendrawtransaction)

Returns the txid of your transaction which can be now tracked in explorer or in wallet itself.
