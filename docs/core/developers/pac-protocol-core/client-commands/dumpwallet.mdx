# dumpwallet
## Command

```bash
pacprotocol-cli dumpwallet "filename"
```

Dumps all wallet keys in a human-readable format to a server-side file. This does not allow overwriting existing files.
Imported scripts are not currently included in wallet dumps, these must be backed up separately.
Note that if your wallet contains keys which are not derived from your HD seed (e.g. imported keys), these are not covered by
only backing up the seed itself, and must be backed up too (e.g. ensure you back up the whole dumpfile).



## Arguments

### `filename` <span class='asterisk'>*</span>
*(string, required)*

The filename


## Examples
```bash
pacglobal-cli dumpwallet "test"
```

```bash
curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "dumpwallet", "params": ["test"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:1111/
```
