# estimatefee
## Command

```bash
pacprotocol-cli estimatefee nblocks
```

DEPRECATED. Please use estimatesmartfee for more intelligent estimates.
Estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin
confirmation within nblocks blocks.



## Arguments

### `nblocks` <span class='asterisk'>*</span>
*(numeric, required)*




## Examples
```bash
pacglobal-cli estimatefee 6
```
## Result
```bash
n              #(numeric) estimated fee-per-kilobyte

A negative value is returned if not enough transactions and blocks
have been observed to make an estimate.
-1 is always returned for nblocks == 1 as it is impossible to calculate
a fee that is high enough to get reliably included in the next block.
```
