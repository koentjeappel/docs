# debug
## Command

```bash
pacprotocol-cli debug "category"
```

debug "category"
Change debug category on the fly. Specify single category or use '+' to specify many.
The valid debug categories are: net, tor, mempool, http, bench, zmq, db, rpc, estimatefee, addrman, selectcoins, reindex, cmpctblock, rand, prune, proxy, mempoolrej, libevent, coindb, qt, leveldb, chainlocks, gobject, instantsend, keepass, llmq, llmq-dkg, llmq-sigs, mnpayments, mnsync, privatesend, spork.
libevent logging is configured on startup and cannot be modified by this RPC during runtime.
There are also a few meta-categories:
 - "all", "1" and "" activate all categories at once;
 - "pacglobal" activates all PACGlobal-specific categories at once;
 - "none" (or "0") deactivates all categories at once.
Note: If specified category doesn't match any of the above, no error is thrown.
