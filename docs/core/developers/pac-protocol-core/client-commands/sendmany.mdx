```



Send two amounts to two different addresses setting the confirmation and comment:

```bash

```



As a json rpc call

```bash
curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "sendmany", "params": ["tabby", "{\"XwnLY9Tf7Zsef8gMGL2fhWA9ZmMjt4KPwG\":0.01,\"XuQQkwA4FYkq2XERzMY2CiAZhJTEDAbtcG\":0.02}", 6, false, "testing"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:1111/
```
## Result
```bash
"txid"                   #(string) The transaction id for the send. Only 1 transaction is created regardless of
