*(string, required)*

The name of the account to send funds from. May be the default account using "".
                       Specifying an account does not influence coin selection, but it does associate the newly created
                       transaction with the account, so the account's balance computation and transaction history can reflect
                       the spend.

*(string, required)*

The dash address to send funds to.

### `addlocked` 
*(bool, optional, default=false)*

Whether to include transactions locked via InstaPAC.


### `comment` 
*(string, optional)*

A comment used to store what the transaction is for. 
                       This is not part of the transaction, just kept in your wallet.


### `comment_to` 
*(string, optional)*

An optional comment to store the name of the person or organization 
                       to which you're sending the transaction. This is not part of the transaction,
