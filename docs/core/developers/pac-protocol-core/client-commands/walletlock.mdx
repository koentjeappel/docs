# walletlock
## Command

```bash
pacprotocol-cli walletlock
```

Removes the wallet encryption key from memory, locking the wallet.
After calling this method, you will need to call walletpassphrase again
before being able to call any methods which require the wallet to be unlocked.



## Examples


Set the passphrase for 2 minutes to perform a transaction

```bash
pacglobal-cli walletpassphrase "my pass phrase" 120
```



Perform a send (requires passphrase set)

```bash
pacglobal-cli sendtoaddress "XwnLY9Tf7Zsef8gMGL2fhWA9ZmMjt4KPwG" 1.0
```



Clear the passphrase since we are done before 2 minutes is up

```bash
pacglobal-cli walletlock 
```



As json rpc call

```bash
curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "walletlock", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:1111/
