# Setting up Swapfile

Setting up swapfile is **optional, but recommended**, in case if the core happens to take more than 1 GB of memory. This helps to avoid crashing core unintended.

```bash
sudo swapoff -a
sudo fallocate -l 5G /swapfile #5GB of swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo "/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
```
